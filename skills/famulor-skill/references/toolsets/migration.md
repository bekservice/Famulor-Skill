# Migration toolset

Previewing and importing supported Famulor 1.0 resources. Connect only this group with `https://app.famulor.io/mcp?toolsets=migration`.

This 2026-10-07 snapshot covers all 2 tools assigned to `migration` in the canonical 437-tool registry. The live MCP `tools/list` response is authoritative for arguments, current availability, annotations, and plan or role gating. Never invent fields from this catalog.

Toolsets limit discovery context; they do not grant access. OAuth/API scopes and workspace roles are enforced separately. The Effect column reflects MCP risk annotations: `Delete/destructive` also covers overwrites or changes that can remove data or safeguards.

**Caution:** Imports create or change workspace resources. Preview the exact source and destination, then confirm before starting an import.
