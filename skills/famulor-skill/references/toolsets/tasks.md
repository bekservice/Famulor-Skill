# Tasks toolset

Durable exports, simulations, crawls, and campaign preparation. Connect only this group with `https://app.famulor.io/mcp?toolsets=tasks`.

This 2026-10-07 snapshot covers all 4 tools assigned to `tasks` in the canonical 437-tool registry. The live MCP `tools/list` response is authoritative for arguments, current availability, annotations, and plan or role gating. Never invent fields from this catalog.

Toolsets limit discovery context; they do not grant access. OAuth/API scopes and workspace roles are enforced separately. The Effect column reflects MCP risk annotations: `Delete/destructive` also covers overwrites or changes that can remove data or safeguards.

**Caution:** History exports can contain sensitive conversation data. Confirm export authority and handle download links privately; check asynchronous task status before claiming completion.

| `prepare_campaign_task` | Write/action | `campaigns:write or calls:write` | Task required | Validate and import a large audience into a paused campaign as a durable, cancellable preparation task. |
| `run_assistant_simulation_task` | Write/action | `assistants:write` | Task required | Run a durable assistant conversation simulation and return its provider-neutral test result when complete. |
