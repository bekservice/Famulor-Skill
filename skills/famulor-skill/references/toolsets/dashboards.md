| Tool | Effect | Accepted scope | Execution | Purpose snapshot |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `create_dashboard` | Write/action | `dashboards:write or calls:write` | Immediate | Create a custom analytics dashboard. The workspace plan must include Custom Dashboards. |
| `create_dashboard_widget` | Write/action | `dashboards:write or calls:write` | Immediate | Create and attach a widget, or attach a reusable widget by supplying widget_id. New widgets require name; all other fields have dashboard defaults. |

Choose email or SMS verification in a root workspace; email uses the platform sender without extra credits, while SMS requires accepting the current price. Returns public_key for embedding.
